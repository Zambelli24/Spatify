<h1>Spatify API</h1>
<p>This is Spatify, the Spotify API companion that allows you to make more direct and specific queries about your favorite artists.</p>
<ul>
  <li>If you wish to search for an artist, you must first find the artist id that Spotify assigns to them </li>
    <ul>
      <li>In order to do this, pass in the name of the artist you wish to find and one of two things will happen:
          <ul>
              <li>you will receive a list artists that match your search</li>
              <li>you will find your desired artist</li>
          </ul>
    </ul>
    <br>
  <li>If you have an artist in mind and would like to find related artists,</li>
    <ul>
        <li>simply pass the name of the artist as the search parameter and receive a list of related artists</li>
